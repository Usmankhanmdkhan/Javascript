    // -A promise is an object that holds the future value of an asynchronous operation.
    // -A Promise object represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved/available at some point in the future.
    // -Promise object can have different states:- pending, resolved/fulfilled, rejected.
    // ex:-if we request some data from a server, promise promises us to get that data 
    // that we can use in the future.  -->
