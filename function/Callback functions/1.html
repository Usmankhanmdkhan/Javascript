        // CallBack
        // --------
        // -A Callback is a function that is passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.
        // -callback function is run inside of the function it was passed into.
        // -A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function,
        //  which contains the logic for when the callback function should be executed.


        // Callback hell
        // -------------
        // -Callback hell will have multiple callbacks nested after each other. 
        // -It can happen when you do an asynchronous activity thatâ€™s dependent 
        //  on a previous asynchronous activity.
        // -Solutions to callback hell:
        // 	1. Split functions into smaller functions.
        // 	2. Using Promises.
        // 	3. Using Async/await.
